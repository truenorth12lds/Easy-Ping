## ü•î Live Demo

Try it!

https://demo.uptime.ping.pet

It is a temporary live demo, all data will be deleted after 10 minutes. The server is located in Tokyo, so if you live far from there, it may affect your experience. I suggest that you should install and try it out for the best demo experience.

VPS is sponsored by Uptime ping sponsors on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/easy-ping)! Thank you so much!

## Motivation

* I was looking for a self-hosted monitoring tool like "Uptime Robot", but it is hard to find a suitable one. One of the close ones is statping. Unfortunately, it is not stable and unmaintained.
* Want to build a fancy UI.
* Learn Vue 3 and vite.js.
* Show the power of Bootstrap 5.
* Try to use WebSocket with SPA instead of REST API.
* Deploy my first Docker image to Docker Hub.
